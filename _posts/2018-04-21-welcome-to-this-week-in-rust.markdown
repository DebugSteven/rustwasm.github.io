Hello and welcome to the another issue of *This Week in Rust+WASM*!

[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.

[WASM](http://webassembly.org) is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
