title: "Rust and WebAssembly in 2019: A Call for Community Blog Posts"
---

[The 2018 edition of Rust has officially shipped! ðŸŽ‰][rust-2018]

The Rust and WebAssembly domain working group's goals have historically been
focused on things we can deliver in tandem for the 2018 edition. Now that the
2018 edition has shipped, it is time to think about what we want to achieve in
2019 and beyond.

Following in the larger Rust project's [tradition][rust-2019-call-for-blogs],
we're asking the community to write blog posts reflecting on Rust and
WebAssembly in 2018 and proposing goals and directions for Rust and WebAssembly
in 2019. We'll read everything, and then propose an [RFC][rust-wasm-rfcs] for
the Rust and WebAssembly domain working group's roadmap in 2019.

## #RustWasm2019

Write down your thoughts on whatever your writing platform of choice is. It
could be:

* Your personal or company blog
* A GitHub gist
* A Medium post
* Any other platform you prefer

We're looking for posts on many different topics:

* Ideas for community programs
* Tooling enhancements
* Ecosystem and library needs
* Documentation improvements
* Anything else related to Rust and Wasm!

Tweet your write up with [the `#RustWasm2019` hashtag][hashtag] or drop a link
on [this github issue][rust-wasm-2019-issue]. We'll aggregate everything
everyone has written in another big post on this blog. Then, the core Rust and
WebAssembly working group team will read over all of them and write up an RFC
for the working group's 2019 roadmap! This RFC will follow our normal [RFC
process][] and everyone will have a chance to discuss it, improve it, and help
polish it.

## Preliminary Timeline

* **Now through January 15<sup>th</sup>:** Share your `#RustWasm2019` post, read
  posts by others, discuss them, bounce ideas back and forth.
* **End of January:** We'll formally propose the 2019 roadmap RFC, and then work
  it through the RFC process together as a community.
* **End of February:** We're aiming for having consensus on the 2019 roadmap and
  merging the RFC before the end of February.

## Thanks for an Awesome 2018!

Thanks to everyone who generated some WebAssembly with Rust in 2018 and thanks
to everyone who helped make that possible!
